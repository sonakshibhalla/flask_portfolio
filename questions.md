_Talk about dopamine issues above. Real? Parent conspiracy? Anything that is impacting your personal study and success in High School?_

Dopamine issues are definitely real because oftentimes, people get addicted to social media and gaming sites, which gives them an unlimited award of dopamine. Our minds get overwhelmed with the amount of dopamine that is rushing in. I experience this personally when I am on my phone instead of doing schoolwork. 

_How does someone empower themself in a digital world?_

People can empower themselves in a digital world by constantly looking for more information and learning more about things that they did not know before. The more knowledge that people can get through digital spaces, the better. It is also always important to think about digital security and safety as social media is becoming more prevalent and invasive. 

_How does someone that is empowered help someone that is not empowered? Describe something you could do at Del Norte HS._

Someone that is empowered, such as students at Del Norte HS, can use the tools provided to us to help others who may not have access to digital spaces and information on the internet. We can go out and help people in the San Diego community who are economically disadvantaged with lessons about computer safety and proper ways to navigate the online world. Additionally, we could make free, accessible programs that are easy to use for people that are not empowered. 

_Is paper or red tape blocking digital empowerment? Are there such barriers at Del Norte? Elsewhere?_

Paper or red tape blocking is exactly the opposite of digital empowerment. There are many such barriers at Del Norte because people are not able to access all the websites and tools they need on the district sponsored wifi. Additionally, the computers and chromebooks have severe restrictions, which is a form of restriction for students. This also exists in workplaces and other public settings.
