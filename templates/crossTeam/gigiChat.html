            because this is being called by an event, the event object is automatically
            passed and captured as seen above. We are capturing it with the 'event' parameter in this function.
            This is frequently represented in the following ways in JS: e, evt and event.
            As a variable, it could be called anything - but it makes more sense to call it event rather than banana... etc.
            Name your variables well, my friends.
