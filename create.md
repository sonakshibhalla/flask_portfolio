# Create Task Plan

My create task plan is a MadLibs, which is a automatically generated story based on words that users input into the program. We thought this would be interesting because our PBL project was regarding student resources and things that could make people relaxed. This is a fun game that students can use to destress and it fits all of the Collegeboard requirements. 

| CollegeBoard Requirement | How it will be fulfilled |
| --- | ----------- |
| Procedure with Input and Output | user inputs words into the madlibs story and there is an output of either a story or an alert reminding people to put in a word |
| Data Collection | we are using lists to store our variables for the inputted words and this adds to the complexity of the program because otherwise, we would have to do each one individually |
| Parameter | function for madlibs calls the three object values as parameters |
| Function | function is created that takes the three objects to make up a story |
| Selection | if statements have been created to alert the user if they left a box blank |
| Sequencing | the procedure follows a logical algorithmical order|
| Iteration | while statement so the code knows to only repeat alerts and input once |
