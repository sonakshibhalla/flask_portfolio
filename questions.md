# TPT Questions

## 5.3 & 5.4
_Does the owner of the computer think this was intentional?_

I believe that the owner of the video does not think that this was intentional, but rather an implict bias in the way that the software was designed which excluding Black facial features. 

_If yes or no, justify you conclusion_

The programmers who designed this facial software on the part of HP were most likely not attempting to be racist, but had a small amount of copmuting bias in the wa that the software likely recognizes white and europen facial features more than other minorities. 

_How do you think this happened?_

I think that this happened because the program was designed to focus on specific facial features and skin tones, but this did not work for people of darker skin tones. 

_Is this harmful? Was it intended to be harmful or exclude?_

Although I don't believe that this was intended to be harmful or exclude certain racial minorities, it can definetely have a harmful effect on those people who the software doesn't recognize, becaue they feel they are being left out and not thought of. 

_Should it be corrected?_

I think this should be corrected to include people of all skin tones and facial features so that the software becomes more inclusive. 

_What would you or should you do to produce a better outcome?_

I would try and test the facial recognition software onto lots of different types of faces and people to make sure that everyone gets detected in the future. 

_CompSci has 150 principles students. Describe a crowdsource idea and how you might initiate it in our environment?_

A crowdsource idea would be to have all the students talk about their pros and cons with their experience in AP Computer Science. They can all provide advice for future students and other notes. 

_What about Del Norte crowdsourcing? Could your final project be better with crowdsourcing?_

Our final project would be good with crowdsourcing because we can ask students and teachers to add input on what types of books and projects they would like to read and conduct. 



## 5.1 & 5.2
_Come up with three of your own Beneficial and corresponding Harmful Effects of Computing_

One beneficial effect is being able to connect around the world globally and have access to a wealth of information
One negative effect of computing is that data can be stolen from you, especially with phishing and hacking attacks for people who are vulnerable
One positive effect is that we can use the power of computing to create new devices and applications that will be helpful in the fields pf medicine and science

_Talk about dopamine issues above. Real? Parent conspiracy? Anything that is impacting your personal study and success in High School?_

Dopamine issues are definitely real because oftentimes, people get addicted to social media and gaming sites, which gives them an unlimited award of dopamine. Our minds get overwhelmed with the amount of dopamine that is rushing in. I experience this personally when I am on my phone instead of doing schoolwork. 

_How does someone empower themself in a digital world?_

People can empower themselves in a digital world by constantly looking for more information and learning more about things that they did not know before. The more knowledge that people can get through digital spaces, the better. It is also always important to think about digital security and safety as social media is becoming more prevalent and invasive. 

_How does someone that is empowered help someone that is not empowered? Describe something you could do at Del Norte HS._

Someone that is empowered, such as students at Del Norte HS, can use the tools provided to us to help others who may not have access to digital spaces and information on the internet. We can go out and help people in the San Diego community who are economically disadvantaged with lessons about computer safety and proper ways to navigate the online world. Additionally, we could make free, accessible programs that are easy to use for people that are not empowered. 

_Is paper or red tape blocking digital empowerment? Are there such barriers at Del Norte? Elsewhere?_

Paper or red tape blocking is exactly the opposite of digital empowerment. There are many such barriers at Del Norte because people are not able to access all the websites and tools they need on the district sponsored wifi. Additionally, the computers and chromebooks have severe restrictions, which is a form of restriction for students. This also exists in workplaces and other public settings.
